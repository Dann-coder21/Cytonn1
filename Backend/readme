## Database Setup

This project uses a **MySQL** database to store user and task information.

### Requirements

- A running MySQL server.

### Setup Instructions

To set up the database for this project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Create the Database:** You can manually create a database named `cyton_project` or let the provided SQL script do it for you.
2.  **Import the SQL Dump File:** Use a MySQL client (such as MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or the command-line interface) to run the `database.sql` file included in the root of this project. This single file will:
    *   Create the `cyton_project` database if it doesn't exist.
    *   Create the `users` and `tasks` tables with the correct structure and relationships.
    *   Populate the tables with sample data, including an admin and several regular users, so you can test the application immediately.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Ensure your backend's `.env` file has the correct database credentials:
    ```env
  # .env file

# --- Database Configuration ---
DB_HOST=localhost 
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234
DB_DATABASE=cyton_project
DB_PORT=3306 

ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE="SUPER_SECRET_123"

EMAIL_USER="kabuedann@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="oinj ihpo ylft gpyq"
    ```

### Sample Login Credentials

Once the database is set up, you can log in with the following sample accounts:

-   **Admin Account:**
    -   **Email:** `admin@example.com`
    -   **Password:** `password`

-   **User Account:**
    -   **Email:** `john.doe@example.com`
